\section{Comments about trials}
\label{comments-about-trials}

During the experiment all the participants were set free to pick up the objects in the order they prefer. All of them use the order as $ \{ $\textit{triangle, trapezoid and circle}$ \} $, but only one decided to pick up the objects in different order for all the trials only in \kt{}. This doesn't affect the data.

For simplicity we summarize by saying that $ \{t1,t2\} $ indicates the task and $ \{r1,r2,r3\}  $ indicates the trial. As described in \ref{experimental-design}, for both task $ \{t1,t2\} $ three trials in both the modalities were done. From these trials it's possible to report some comments.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\Kt{} teaching}
	
	Only one user, for every trial, took many waypoints even after it was shown to him how the robot replicates the sequence. Moreover, sometimes some users wrong in taking the waypoint and open/close the gripper, but this not affect the final realization. Finally, an expert user takes a point just above the place position to make the interlocking without problems: this happens only for the second task.
	
	\item \textbf{\Te{} teaching}
	
	Out of ten users, seven of them made a collision: the robot exerts too much force on a surface and this activates the collision avoidance feature. In figure \ref{fig:pass_fail} successes and failures during teaching phase are shown. We can see that the first and the second column, that are the first trials, have a high number of failures.
	In task $ t1-r3 $ and task $ t2-r1,r2 $ it's possible to see that there was only a mistake by all the users: this is acceptable. The surprising value is the last one (task $ t2 $ and trial $ r3 $): it would have been logical that this value was zero because it was the last trial and the user had become more experienced with the pad.
	The users who made these mistakes were only those who started with \te{}. Overall the error rate during the teach phase is $ 16.6\% $: for a better report it's possible to resume the success rate for each trial of all users as evidenced in table \ref{tab:pass}. It was also noted that during the trials they sometimes forgot to save the waypoints and it was remembered to the users to save them for a better replay phase.

\section{Questionnaire results}
\label{questionnaire-results}

As described in section \ref{post-experiment-phase}, the questionnaire was divided into two phases: the first part has already been presented in \ref{participants}, while the second part asked some questions which had to be answered with a value between $ 1 $ and $ 10 $. The questions with the most important results are presented here.

\begin{itemize}
	\item How much \textbf{physical effort} was required for \te{}/\kt{} teaching?
	
	In figure \ref{fig:physical_effort} we can immediately spot the differences between the two modalities: in \kt{} since the task were performed moving the robot, a force to move it is necessary. The medium value is $ 5 $ which tells us that it's actually not so difficult to move the robot. On the other side, the boxplot relative to \te{} indicates that there's no physical effort for moving the robot.
	
	\begin{figure}[ht]

		\caption{Physical effort in \kt{} and \te{} teaching}
		\label{fig:physical_effort}
	\end{figure}
	
	% todo newpage
	\newpage
	\item How much \textbf{mental effort} was required for \te{}/\kt{} teaching?
	
	In figure \ref{fig:mental_effort} it's possible to immediately spot that the two modalities requires mental effort similar among them. We can notice that the medium value for \te{} is higher that the medium one in \kt{}. Obviously, in \te{} for moving the robot it's necessary to remember all the buttons and commands that have been taught in teach phase before the experiment, but this values is lowered by the users which have confidence with the pad. %Moreover a greater mental effort is required by the user have to coordinate and understand the reference frame that is used on the robot compared to the one you are used to using.
	
	\begin{figure}[ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{mental_effort.png}
		\caption{Mental effort in \kt{} and \te{} teaching}
		\label{fig:mental_effort}
	\end{figure}

\end{itemize}

From the final comments not obligatory for the purposes of the questionnaire, the users said that the \te{} is very interesting and they propose to map a new button on pad to move faster on long movements and another one to be better precise with the rotation of the EE. In addition, they propose to add an audio feedback (not only the \textit{rgb} led) after getting the pose or changing the control mode. Moreover, an user propose to let him choose the reference frame that is used to move the robot.

\section{Groups}
\label{groups}

From the questionnaire questions and answers is possible to create some different groups based on personal characteristics. Many different factors were analyzed to see if there was a correlation between the various characteristics of the users and the results obtained from the experiment. From the data is possible to determine two possible classifications.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Physical characteristics}
	
	In questionnaire was asked the weight and height keeping a range between $ 10kg $ and $ 10cm $. From the answers is possible to classify two macro groups, both of them composed by five users.
	The first group is composed by the users which height is less or equal than $ 70kg $ and which height it's less or equal than $ 180cm $. This group is  conveniently identified and referenced in the next sections with \smallusers{}, that stands for \textit{low body users}. The other group, identified with \bigusers{}, that stands for \textit{tall body users}, is composed by users with weight greater that $ 70kg $ and height grater than $ 170cm $. There are also two users in this group that are taller than $ 180cm $.	

	\item \textbf{Confidence with the pad}
	
	The same reasoning can be applied to this classification. In the questionnaire was asked the level of confidence with the pad, that is with how frequency the pad is used from the users. From the answers two macro groups both of them composed by five people have been identified. The users who replied more than once a week and at least once a month were classified as regular players and these users were called \textbf{RP}. The users who replied that they use the pad once a year or they never used it were classified as casual players and they were called \textbf{CP}. Also all the users who have used the pad in the past are casual players.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, during the experiment phase five users were made to start with the phase related to \kt{} teaching and the other five with \te{} teaching to better divide users into groups for a possible analysis of these factors as well. The results obtained starting from the two classifications described above and from the questionnaire are explained in chapter \ref{results-discussion}.

\section{Data analysis}
\label{data-analysis}

To have groups with better data one user for each group, with an elevate standard deviation calculated for each task over the three trials, have been removed.\\
In the following tables time and distance to complete each task in both the modalities were represented as difference between the two groups that were created based on physical characteristics. 
In table \ref{tab:time} the values are described in terms of seconds, instead in table \ref{tab:distance} the values presented are in meters. For both tables the first two columns indicates the groups, while the third one indicates the difference between the \smallusers{} and \bigusers{} groups. In the last column the gain between the performances of the two groups was expressed as percentage. The rows represent which task was performed and in which mode. The positive and negative symbol was kept to indicate which of the two groups resulted faster or which one made less distance.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l||cccc}
		& \smallusers & \bigusers & \textbf{Difference} & \textbf{Gain}\\
		\hline \hline
		\textbf{TT - Task1} & $ 147 $ & $ 154 $ & $ -7 $  & $ -4,5\% $\\
		\textbf{KT - Task1} & $ 70 $  & $ 64 $  & $ +6 $ & $ 9,4\% $\\
		\textbf{TT - Task2} & $ 175 $ & $ 192 $ & $ -17 $ & $ -8,9\% $\\
		\textbf{KT - Task2} & $ 70 $  & $ 62 $  & $ +8 $  & $ 12,3\% $
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Time difference in seconds between the two groups}
	\label{tab:time}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l||cccc}
		& \smallusers & \bigusers & \textbf{Difference} & \textbf{Gain}\\
		\hline \hline
		\textbf{TT - Task1} & $ 2,10 $ & $ 2,23 $ & $ -0,13 $ & $ -5,8\% $\\
		\textbf{KT - Task1} & $ 2,54 $ & $ 2,39 $ & $ +0,15 $ & $ 6,3\% $\\
		\textbf{TT - Task2} & $ 1,97 $ & $ 2,34 $ & $ -0,37 $ & $ -15,8\% $\\
		\textbf{KT - Task2} & $ 2,54 $ & $ 2,29 $ & $ +0,25 $ & $ 10,9\% $
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Distance difference in meters between the two groups}
	\label{tab:distance}
\end{table}

The two figures in \ref{fig:time_and_distance_group_t2} indicate the same values of the previous tables. The figure \ref{fig:time_groups_t2} represents graphically the table \ref{tab:time}, and the values on $ x $ axis are in seconds. Instead in figure \ref{fig:distance_groups_t2.png} there are the data represented in table \ref{tab:distance}, and the values on $ x $ axis are in meters. From these figures is possible to quickly understand the differences between the two groups and the different modalities. Moreover it's possible to understand the correlation between time and distance. Only times and distances for the task $ t1 $ were represented in these figures because the figures for task $ t2 $ are similar but with the values described in the relevant table.

From the questionnaire, the data relative to physical and mental effort have been collected. These data have been manipulated with division into groups based on physical characteristics. In table \ref{tab:effort} there is the average of the values indicated by the users in questionnaire. The value was in scale from $ 1 $ to $ 10 $. As the previous tables, on the first and second column there are the two groups. Instead, on the rows there are the efforts for each modality. The first two rows are relative to mental effort, the first one in \te{} and the second one in \kt{}. The third row is relative to physical effort in \te{} and the last one refers to \kt{}. The overall values without the divisions into groups can be seen in figure \ref{fig:mental_effort} for mental effort, and in figure \ref{fig:physical_effort} for physical effort.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l||cc}

		\textbf{KT - Physical} 	& $ 5,4 $ & $ 3,8 $
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Physical and mental effort in both the modalities}
	\label{tab:effort}
\end{table}

As described in the previous chapter, many data were collected during the experiment. One of these was the \texttt{cartesian\_wrench}: it's composed of a vector that represent the force along the three spatial directions $ \{ x,y,z \} $. In figure \ref{fig:plot_wrench} it's possible to see the differences between the force applied on EE during the experiment: in \te{} the interaction forces are limited instead in \kt{} the forces are high.  In both figures on $ y $ axis there's the force applied on $ z $ expressed in $ N $, and along $ x $ axis there is the time in seconds to complete the trial. In these figures only one trial of the same user was represented. The same graphs, that are similar, can be calculated on forces applied on $ x $ and $ y $.

	\caption{Difference between force on $ z $ expressed in $ N $ \\in \te{} and \kt{} teaching}
	\label{fig:plot_wrench}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:wrench_all} there is another representation of \texttt{cartesian\_wrench} calculated on $ x,y,z $. These figures represent the differences between \kt{} and \te{} teaching between the two groups. All the boxplots shown in both the figures are divided in three groups (a group for each value of the wrench $\{ x,y,z \}$) where every group has two boxplots: the first one for \smallusers{} group and the second one for \bigusers{} group.
Each boxplot represent the sum of the forces applied on a certain axes of the EE by all users divided per groups while they were performing all the trials $\{ r1,r2,r3\} $ of each task $\{ t1,t2 \}$.
On $ x $ axis the force applied on EE is represented in $ N $.

The table in figure \ref{tab:ratio} represents the total number of waypoints taken by the groups during all trials for each task in different modalities. It's possible to notice that there are two macro columns for the two groups where each of them contains other three columns. For each macro column, the first column contains the number of trials completed by all users of the group. The second column contains the number of waypoints taken by all users during all the trials and the third column is the ratio between the two first columns (waypoints/trials). Finally, the rows represent the modality and the task that is performed.
The minimum number of waypoints to have a task that can be replayed correctly by the \kuka{} is $ 16 $: three points for every objects except only two points for the first and last object. Instead the optimal number is $ 18 $: three points for every object to pick and place.

	\end{tabular}

	\caption{Difference on waypoints taken during the execution of the task} 
	\label{tab:ratio}
\end{table}

In figure \ref{fig:waypoints} are shown the waypoints taken during the execution of the task $ t1 $. The figures of task $ t2 $ are similar to the figures of the task $ t1 $. The red points were referred to \smallusers{} group, instead the blue ones were for \bigusers{} group. On $ x $ and $ y $ axis there is the locations of the points within the space. The distance values between the points are expressed in $ cm $. Each black figure indicates the position of the shapes, while the $ \square $ mark indicates the position of the cube above each object to facilitate grasping. The red waypoints are relative to \smallusers{}, while the blue ones are for \bigusers{} group. All waypoints aren't centered with the figure because the position saved is the one relative to the center of the media flange mounted on the robot.
